# Course objectives
	
Learning an overview of approaches to Computational Social Systems from the perspectives of:

- Computer Science
- Sociology
- Business Administration
- Psychology 
- Law studies

Students will become familiar with the **interdisciplinary bridges** between approaches and how **current research** is connecting disciplines. 

A successful student of this course will be able to **discuss a topic** in Computational Social Systems from the viewpoint of **various disciplines**.

# Tandems
<center>![:scale 67%](tandem.jpg)

The course is structured in four tandems, each with two lecturers. Each tandem has a lecturer with a Computer Science background from TU Graz and a lecturer from University of Graz with experience in one of the other four disciplines.

# Student projects

- Course evaluation is based on group student projects
- Project aim: preparation for empirical analysis to be done in other courses (e.g. Foundations of Computational Social Systems)
- Lecturers will propose topics and suggested readings by Oct 25th
- You can select your own topic if it's related to Computational Social Systems
- Suggested parts for the project:  

  - Topic motivation and relevance for research and society at large
  - Brief literature review on the topic
  - Cases on the topic, possibly including practical examples
  - Interdisciplinary considerations and differences between approaches
  - Students' position on the topic: questions and ideas
  

---

# Course assessment


- Student projects should be developed during the course and presented in one of the last three sessions

- Course lecturers can ask questions to the students after each presentation

-  By the end of the course, a short written report on the project has to be submitted (max 6 pages, single column, 11pt)

- The grading scheme for the course is 50% for the presentation and 50% for the report 

*Two additional dates will be announced for written replacement examination dates, but we encourage students to participate in the student projects instead.*

---

# Student groups

- Student groups for the projects can contain at most 4 students

- Each student group must mix students from at least two different majors in the programme

- Groups can be the same as in Foundations of CSS, but not necessarily

- Send the list of group names to css@tugraz.at before Oct 25th

- All students in the group should participate in the project work, the report writing, and the presentation. If problems arise, contact  css@tugraz.at
