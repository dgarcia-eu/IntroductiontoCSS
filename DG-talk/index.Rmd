## The Social Function of Collective Emotions

<center>
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ColectiveEmotions.png")
```
</center>

- **Theory of collective effervescence** (Durkheim, 1912):
Shared emotions generate social identity, reinforce shared beliefs, and lead to higher solidarity

- **Collective emotions** (von Scheve and Salmela, 2014):   
Emotional states shared by a large amount of people at the same time

## Emotional Responses to Collective Traumas

**How do societies respond to traumatic events?**  
**Is there a social function of collective emotions?**
.pull-left[
- Emotional synchronization: Experience of simultaneous negative emotions

- Collective emotion lasts longer than individual emotional reactions

- Individuals that participate in the collective emotions show higher levels of long-term solidarity ]

Division of users into two groups based on their emotional expression two weeks after the attacks

Frequency of social process terms:
- Very similar before the attacks
- Strong difference after the attacks
- Difference lasts for months

Similar effect for prosocial terms and shared values terms
]

---

## Conclusions

- Terrorist attacks trigger collective emotions that we can observe online

- Terms related to social resilience increase after collective emotions

- Individuals expressing stronger emotions used on average more terms related to social processes, prosocial behavior, and shared values

- Collective emotions are not just venting, they can keep us together

- Negative effects: inter-group conflict, intolerance, short-term orientation...

## EAT-Lancet and yes2meat: Summary

- We mapped the digital backlash to EAT-Lancet on Twitter through #yes2meat
- Birth of #yes2meat preceded the release of the report
- Four communities: pro-EAT-Lancet, skeptic, pro-yes2meat, and vegan
- Information flow from pro-yes2meat to skeptic community after report
- Diet polarization: liberal vegan vs conservative keto

Example of emerging polarization towards hyperpolarization as in Weighted Balance Theory

# Summary

- Digital trace data, including social media data, offer new opportunities for research in the social sciences, especially sociology and psychology

- Scientific challenges ahead! This is an uncharted territory and validation and replication are very important

- With Big Data comes great responsibility: privacy and ethics are important

- If you like data analysis, think about us for a research project! 
If you are interested, send me an email with your **CV and transcript of records.**
